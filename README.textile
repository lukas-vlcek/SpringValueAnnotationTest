h1. Spring @Value Annotation test

Purpose of this simple application is to test if Spring @Value annotation can be used to inject values into servlets that are managed by servlet container.

h2. Installation

* clone to your local disk
* build with maven: @mvn package@
* deploy @deploy_this.war@ file into tomcat
* open browser and navigate to "http://localhost:8080/deploy_this/":http://localhost:8080/deploy_this/

You should see a simple HTML page with two links: @foo@ and @bar@

Clicking @foo@ will display content of "inject.properties":https://github.com/lukas-vlcek/SpringValueAnnotationTest/blob/master/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/inject.properties file.

Clicking @bar@ results into "this exception":https://gist.github.com/1111456. Now, I would like to know how to make lines 16 and 17 in "Bar":https://github.com/lukas-vlcek/SpringValueAnnotationTest/blob/master/src/main/java/org/test/springframework/inject/Bar.java servlet working correctly (if it is possible at all).

h2. Spring Forum

I created a new "thread":http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?112716-Using-Value-to-inject-primitive-value-from-property-file-into-servlet-possible in Spring Community Forum. If you want to comment, consider doing it there...
